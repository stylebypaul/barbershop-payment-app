Excellent! ðŸŽ‰ Great job creating the backend files! Now let's create the frontend structure and files.

Next Step: Create the Frontend Files
Let's create the frontend folder and all the React files:

1. Create the frontend package.json
Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file"
Filename: frontend/package.json
Paste this content:
{
  "name": "barber-pay-frontend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Professional barbershop payment application",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2",
    "axios": "^1.6.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
